;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The main features of this Groovy mode are syntactic
;; highlighting (enabled with `font-lock-mode' or
;; `global-font-lock-mode'), automatic indentation and filling of
;; comments.
;;
;; This package has (only) been tested with Carbon "Summer" Emacs 22.1.1.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Put this file in a directory where Emacs can find it (`C-h v
;; load-path' for more info). Then add the following lines to your
;; Emacs initialization file:
;;
;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.groovy\\'" . groovy-mode))
;;    (autoload 'groovy-mode "groovy" nil t)
;;
;; General Remarks:
;;
;; This mode assumes that block comments are not nested inside block
;; comments and that strings do not contain line breaks.
;;
;; Exported names start with "groovy-" whereas private names start
;; with "gr-".
;;
